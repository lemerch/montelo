## About

Montelo [μοντέλο - montélo] - model. Ideas are abstractions - the property of thinking differently than we see the world. With this property of the brain, we are who we are. According to Plato, there is a special world, the world of ideas. Ideas are often presented as our ideal. 

People often treat them with disdain, talking about tall tales, etc. However, it is mathematics that is also the idea that describes and connects the world of ideas with the real.

In this library, a simple concept of modules is described. You can create your own models or use these models to describe the result you expect from other tools.
